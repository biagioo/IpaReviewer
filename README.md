# README

This is my IPA reviewer app. It allows you to create IPA's, and review them with a regular account. If you decide to sign up as a Admin, you will have the ability to delete IPA's.

Feel free to watch the video demo of the application in use https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W6ulL9hALxvYUVwB-zbYQKpcey93G8bt/view?usp=sharing

To get this app running, fork and clone this repository and be sure to run bundle install.
After that, type 'rails s' in the terminal and migrate over to your browser and go to localhost:3000.
Sign up/sign in and enjoy!
